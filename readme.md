## Welcome!

This project is inspired by my professor saying that python is more similar to ChatGPT than C. As I have a healthy disdain for the black box of lies and deceit, my impressionable youthfulness is driving me to start a project once and for all that is compiles (as opposed to interpreted). 

This will be written in C, using neovim on Konsole, within an arch linux system I dutifully proselytize about. Each individual statement in this past sentence is true, but please regard it as a joke regardless. 

During a DnD session earlier today (August 5th, 2025), I realized I had packed away my dice in preparation for moving. While my party was busy being terrified by a door, I wrote up a very fast (yet immensely satisfying) CLI dice roller in Python. Unfortunately, my aforementioned advisor made the aforementioned claim which is leading me to the aforementioned decision that I will rewrite it (and add extensions) in C. As of today (still August 5th, 2025), I am requesting you send me thoughts, prayers, and a chipotle doordash if you're feeling generous. 

Live long and prosper more than my art/theater double major roommate will, 
Sadie
